## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### Signup Flow (Admin Only)
1. Check if any company exists
2. If no company exists, allow signup
3. Create company with currency from country API
4. Create admin user linked to company
5. Generate JWT token with role and company info

### Login Flow
1. Validate credentials
2. Return user data with company info
3. Generate JWT token with role and company info
4. Redirect based on role:
   - Admin → `/dashboard/admin`
   - Manager → `/dashboard/approvals`
   - Employee → `/dashboard/expenses`

### User Creation (Admin Only)
1. Admin creates users via dashboard
2. Users receive credentials from admin
3. Users can only login, not signup directly

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Companies Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- name (Company Name)
- currency (Auto-detected from country)
- country (Selected during signup)
- admin_id (Reference to admin user)
- created_at, updated_at
```

### Users Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- name (User's full name)

- password (Hashed with bcrypt)
- role (admin, manager, employee)
- company_id (Reference to company)
